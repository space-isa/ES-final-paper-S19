A home for my final paper, written for ES 563: US Empire/Imperialism. 

Abstract: 

The purpose of this work is twofold. First, it seeks to provide a broad critical overview of the history of space science and space exploration, and the legacy of colonialism and diffusionist ideology that persists in these fields. The analysis is then supplemented with current decolonization efforts that are working towards dispensing with the polarizing “Western versus Indegineous” systems of knowl- edge narrative to provide a more multifaceted, nuanced, and diverse view of what science, the arts, and our future can be.
